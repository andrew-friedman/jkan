<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The opioid crisis has devastated communities in Boston and across the country. One of the effects of the crisis is a nationwide increase in the number of used needles found in public spaces. The used needles could transmit Blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B, to drug users who use the needles and members of the public who accidently come into contact with the needles. In 2015, Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh founded the Mobile Sharps Collection Team to pickup used needles found in public spaces. The following paper will give suggestions to the Mobile Sharps Collection Team on how to improve their effectiveness.\n

<h3>Suggestion</h3>

<p>
Suggestions: The suggestions from the analysis are for members of the Mobile Sharps Collection Team to conduct daily searches before 7 AM and 5 PM of areas with higher than average amounts of needles found. The targeted daily searches before high traffic times would not require large amounts of resources and could greatly limit the publicâ€™s potential exposure to blood-borne diseases from used needles.
